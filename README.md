#Dolphin.js JumpStart#

This project provides a step-by-step introduction to use OpenDolphin on the web (http://open-dolphin.org)
- with plain Java (you can use any JVM language, particularly Groovy)
- with a simple Servlet (you can use any other Java Server technology as well: Grails, JEE6/7, Vert.x, etc.)

A thorough description of all the steps in the jumpstart is in the OpenDolphin user guide:
